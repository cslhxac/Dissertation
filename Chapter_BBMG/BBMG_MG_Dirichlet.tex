\section{Dirichlet Condition Coarsening}
To coarsening Dirichlet conditions, we choice the geometric coarsening strategy introduced in Section~\ref{sec:geo_coarsen}, with some modifications. Dirichlet condition are imposed at cell granularity. At top level Dirichlet cells are marked \textit{X Dirichlet}, \textit{Y Dirichlet}, \textit{Z Dirichlet}, or any combination of the three based on which degrees of freedom are fixed. If a cell is marked Dirichlet, all of its nodes are marked Dirichlet as well. 

For the coarse level, the additional rotational degrees of freedom also needs to be marked as Dirichlet. For 2D, if a cell is fixed, either in X or Y, it will not be able to rotate, therefore the rotational degrees of freedom at the coarse level will also be marked as Dirichlet. For 3D, if a cell is fixed in X dimension, the cell would not be able to rotate in Y and Z axis, but still allows to rotate in X axis. Therefore, in this case, only the rotational degrees of freedom associated with Y axis rotation and Z axis rotation are marked as Dirichlet, the X axis rotation remains free.

\section{Choice of Smoother}
In Section~\ref{sec:Prolongation_Coarse}, a defect of the method was noted, that the coarse level,  $\hat{\epsilon}_1$ may not be $\in \text{Range}(\mathbf{L}^{(p)}_{ff})$ for Theorem~\ref{theo:p_solution}. This implies that for some nodes, the local convergence metric can be $K_{i,p} = \infty$. In such cases, a point based smoother may not sufficient. Therefore, for all the coarse levels, a colored box smoother of radius $2$ is used. This problem does not exist at the finest level, therefore, an eight-colored Guass-Seidel smoother is used at the finest level as presented in Section~\ref{sec:topopt_multigrid}. 

Because of that our Dirichlet condition is geometrically coarsened, to ensure the multigrid is stable, we will need extra boundary smoothing iterations. The boundary nodes are defined as: within $\mathbf{3}$ stencil distance from a Dirichlet node. For box smoother, we use boundary cells, defined as: within $\mathbf{2}$ cell radius in either axis of a Dirichlet cell. When using this stencil aware multigrid scheme as a preconditioner for conjugate gradient, we found a standard 3-1-3 scheme: 3 boundary smoothing, 1 interior smoothing, and 3 boundary smoothing again, is sufficient.

\section{Stencil Aware Multigrid as Preconditioner}
For better convergence behavior, instead of using the stencil aware multigrid as a standalone solver, we used a symmetric implementation of it to use it as a preconditioner for conjugate gradient.

For better convergence and avoid null space when setting up local problem, we also choice to pad the domain at the finest level with a minimal stiffness cells, only for the preconditioner, so that all finest cells contained by the coarse cells at the lowest level exists. 
 \section{Solver Convergence Analysis}
 To test the solver convergence in comparison to standard multilinear interpolated multigrid, we conducted tests both synthetic and naturally emerged from topology optimization process.

 The two level convergence test is conducted on a synthetic domain of size $32^3$, Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic_domain}. Figure~\ref{fig:Two_Level_Convergence} shows the convergence rate of different methods for the synthetic domain. We can see that multilinear multigrid (MLMG), convergence rate has drastically slowed down after 10 iterations, while stencil aware multigrid (SAMG) maintained the convergence rate of 0.5, that the residual reduces by half every iteration. Using stencil aware multigrid as a preconditioner for conjugate gradient (SAMGPCG), can even further improves convergence rate.
