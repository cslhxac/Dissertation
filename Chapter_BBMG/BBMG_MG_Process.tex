\section{Construction of the Hierarchy}
Now with the computation of the prolongation operator $\mathbf{P}$, which is a 27 point stencil in 3D with each spoke a $3 \times 6$ matrix. We can construct a \textit{two-level} multigrid using a standard Galerkin coarsening process. The multigrid solver is same as algorithm~\ref{alg:vcycle}.
