\chapter{Introduction}
This documents presents a set of techniques and algorithms in solving large scale linear equations that emerged from the simulations of physical phenomenal. Those techniques has enabled large scale simulations that provides not only significantly more visual details but also higher fidelity solutions, and exposes challenges that were previously unrecognized in small scale simulations.

Those techniques are demonstrated in the context of heterogenous poisson equation, 2nd order accurate fluid simulation, and large scale linear elasticity solver for topology optimization.
